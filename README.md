# Telecom_churn_case_study
To carry out domain analysis of the churn rate in the telecom industry
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple
service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.
In this project, we will analyze customer-level data of a leading
telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high
risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
Retaining highly profitable customers is the main business goal here.
